*** Using AddProximityAlerts
// This will definitely eat your battery real quick. You never want to be setting more than a couple of proximity alerts in any case, 
// the use-case you describe isn't really catered for in Proximity Alerts. Proximity Alerts should switch between GPS and Network as 
// required, but in my experience they tend to stick to GPS whenever it's available, and your battery will suffer as a result.A better 
// alternative would be to use an Alarm and a Service to check your current location against your set of 20 to 80 locations as required. 
// This will let you manage the LBS you want to use (GPS or Cell ID), as well as the frequency of checks, all in one place. Doing it this 
// way will let you manage your battery use much more effectively.


*** Having Service start at Bootup
It is much better to have the app that uses the service start the
service when it needs it and simply leaves it running. 

To amplify -- just starting your service at boot and leaving it running all
of the time is NOT recommended.  It consumes a lot of resources, if nothing
else a whole process sitting there doing nothing (presumably) most of the
time, when that memory could be used for other things.


*** database - sqlite
-  model / view / persistence
- ContentProvider provides the public interface to the persistence tier;
- CP offer generic interface to any data source by decoupling data storage layer (persistence) layer from   
- CP expose data with URIs "content://"
- Applications use ContentResolver to get to ContentProvider
- Query methods return Cursor
- use ContentValues to generate values object.

: Database creation and version management -> SQLiteOpenHelper
- methods include onCreate, onUpgrade, onOpen, close, getWritableDatabase

: Manage Database -> SQLiteDatabase
- methods include execSQL, close, query, delete

: Access to database is restricted to the application that created it
